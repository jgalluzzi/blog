And now I need to (forgot) to commit my dir changes from vscode. Nope not going down that road right now. I'll just make them in github.

I had to make new files. No button to move a directory in the web console.



## Github
``` diff
- I chose github to host my blog to keep a low carbon footprint. A way to communicate using less resources. Not really. But you could say. 

+ I just thought it was a neat idea. I could hide little jokes or other things in the commit notes and other features. As I discover how to use github.
