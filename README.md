Banging my head around AWS in the start of a new home lab. 

Just spent 20 minutes trying tp download a .deb via curl with bad info on how to do it from Bing AI.

I was trying
  curl https://github.com/arkime/arkime/releases/download/v5.2.0/arkime_5.2.0-1.ubuntu2204_amd64.deb
vs
  curl -O -k -L https://github.com/arkime/arkime/releases/download/v5.2.0/arkime_5.2.0-1.ubuntu2204_amd64.deb

Now I'm on debian trying to get opensearch to install. Its fucked. It won't install or uninstall or start the service. 
Do I try elastichsearch instead?

Got Elasticsearch install after rebuilding for ubuntu 22 and armine installed. But now elasticsearch isn't working.
